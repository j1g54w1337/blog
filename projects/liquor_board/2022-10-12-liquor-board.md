# Description
My good friend Jarek made a Liquor Board for the kitchen wall to store the **43** booze! Since our kitchen is a bit dark
I thought it would be an awesome idea to pimp it with controlable LED's.

# Stuff you need
- Liquid Board (DUH!)
- ESP32 Development Board
- ws2812b LED's 5 meter 60 leds a meter
- 12A Power supply for the ESP32 Development board and the ws2812b LED strip
