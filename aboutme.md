# Moi
My name is Maikel Dolle and go around on the internet as John Kramer a.k.a. **j!g$@w / j1g54w**. I'm an autodidact and diagnosed with A.S.S. and A.D.D. which makes me "special" they say. :)
Ok, I've to agree, there is always something to happen when you are around me. :) Oh Joy!

I'm passionated on everything which have something to do with computers and music. I'm creative and eager to absorb
knowledge.

With my 100.000 hobbies it's hard to finish one of my 1001 ideas, but in some special occasions I'm actually able to
finish my cool nerdy stuff. But in the core of all the hobbies and ideas you'll always find something the has something
to do with IT or Music.

Working for a large bank as DevOps Specialist I'm able to fulfill most of my passion on a daily basis with the best IT
specialists around. After the regular working days I like to work on building websites, desktop publishing, music and
audio and just being creative. Not to forget my passion for writing Python code, exploiting k8s and OffSec.
