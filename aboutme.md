# Moi

My name is Maikel Dollé and go around on the internet as John Kramer, a.k.a. **j!g$@w / j1g54w**. I’m an autodidact and diagnosed with A.S.S. and A.D.D. which makes me “special” they say. :) Ok, I’ve to agree, there is always something to happen when you are around me. :) Oh, Joy!!

I’m passionate on everything which have something to do with computers and music. I’m creative and eager to absorb knowledge.

With my 100.000 hobbies it’s hard to finish one of my 1001 ideas, but in some special occasions I’m actually able to finish my cool nerdy stuff. But in the core of all the hobbies and ideas you’ll always find something the has something to do with IT or Music.

Working for a large bank as DevOps Specialist, I can fulfill most of my passion daily with the best IT specialists around. After the regular working days I like to work on building websites, desktop publishing, music and audio and just being creative. Not to forget my passion for writing Python code, exploiting k8s and OffSec.

My best friend is Jax, a scary American Pocket Bully but with a heart of gold. And my best girly friend will be my Kawasaki Z1000 2016 Sugomi Edition which wants to kill me every time I intend to ride her.
