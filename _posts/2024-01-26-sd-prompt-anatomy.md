# Stable Diffusion - Prompt Anatomy

Creation a good prompt for great images in Stable Diffusion can be really hard, they will be complex at some point and a single tiny mistake is made easy and hard to find. For me it was really helpful to understand what the Stable Diffusion Prompt Anatomy is and how it works. This definitly won't make me the Rembrandt of GenAI but I'm able to create some nice images now.

I made a post on the anatomy of the prompt focussing on the **positive** prompt in this post and hope it will help you a bit in your journey of creating GenAI Art!

If you have any suggestions for improvements of anything else..... Let me know!

Cheers!
